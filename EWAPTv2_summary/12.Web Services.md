1. Introduction
- A web service is a server side program that provides functionalities
- The main purpose of using web services is to have an interoperable architecture that is able to connect different devices and different pieces software together
- They are usually intended to facilitate:
	1. Integration between applications: application 'A' uses features implemented in application 'B'
	2. Separation within an application: front-end scripts that use web services functionalities to update the content
- Web services often depict the actual business services provided by a company.
***
2. Web Services Implementations
- Web services can be implemented in many different ways.
- Web services can be implemented in many different ways. The most commonly used and popular ones are:
	1.` XML-RPC` : remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that uses XML (usually over HTTP) to invoke functionalities.
	2. `JSON-RPC` : remote procedure call protocol that uses JSON
	3. `SOAP` : messaging protocol that uses XML and provides more functionalities of XML-RPC
	4. `RESTful` : set or principles to build a web service.

- XML-RPC :
	- It works by sending HTTP requests that call a single method implemented on the remote system.
- JSON-RPC : 
	- akes less space to send the same message XML-RPC sends.
	- It has three properties:
		1. method: name of the method to invoke
		2. params: array of objects to pass as arguments
		3. id: request ID used to match the responses/requests
- SOAP : Simple Object Access Protocol
	- Is somehow the successor of XML-RPC since it provides more functionalities such as encryption, digital signature, and routing of SOAP messages.
	- SOAP web services may also provide a Web Services Definition Language (WSDL) declaration that specifies how they may be used.
- RESTful (RESTful APIs) : Representational State Transfer
	- Is not a protocol, but rather a set of principle to build web services that focuses on system's resources.
	- REST web services generally use JSON or XML, but any other message transport format (such as plain-text) is possible.
	- RESTful APIs are generally based on HTTP verbs to determine the action:
		- GET , PUT, POST, DELETE
***
3. The WSDL Language
- A web service is characterized by:
	- One or more Methods 
	- A Protocol
- WSDL stands for Web Services Description Language.
	- such as SOAP, use the WSDL language
	- WSDL is an XML-based interface description language.
	- The description contains different objects depending on the WSDL version;
	- the objects describe the messages, the services, how they can be requested, how they can be transported.
	- versions: 1.1 and 2.0.
	- WSDL documents have abstract and concrete definitions:
		- Abstract: describes what the service does
		- Concrete: adds information about how the web service communicates and where the functionality is offered

		- this file contains the description of all the provided services, Before requesting a service, the client application will ask for the WSDL file.

4. Attacks

1. Enumerate WSDL files
	- `filetype:wsdl site: <yourTarget>`
	- `inurl:wsdl site: <yourTarget>`
	- Another way to discover WSDL files is by appending ?wsdl,.wsdl or ?disco to the end of the service URL
	- Once we find WSDL files we can start inspecting them and gather valuable information about the web service,such as operations, data, syntax and much more.
- Note : 
	1. `DISCO` is a Microsoft .NET Web Services discovery tool used to discover the URLs of XML Web services located on a Web Server,`.disco` documents are XML files that, similarly to WSDL, describe the Web service.
	2. `UDDI` is a directory service used for storing information about web services.anyone can search for information about Web Services that are made available by or on behalf of a business.
The attack consists of the following few steps :
1. The attacker starts the client application and gets the WSDL file
2. The attacker analyzes the WSDL file to look for hidden methods and to get general information about the structure of each operation
3. The attacker invokes some (hidden) methods


2. SOAPAction SPoofing : The SOAP standard permits one to specify a SOAPAction header.
	- This is a specific header containing the operationâ€™s name
	- Its goal is to inform the web service what operation is contained in the SOAP Body without needing XML parsing.

firewall could allow a request with a correct SOAP body but, not a maliciou SOAPAction header

- In order to mount this attack, the following is necessary :

	- The attacker has access to the WSDL file, and knows all the services (methods) offered by the server application.
	- The attacker knows and can reach the end-point of the web service.
	- Some web service methods are protected by a firewall and cannot be invoked.
	- The firewall filters the requests only by SOAP body.
	- The server application relies on the SOAPAction header to detect the operation type.

- The remote attacker can invoke the method deleteAllStudents by sending a HTTP request with the SOAPAction header set to deleteAllStudents and the SOAP body set as the previous request. The firewall will not filter the request because the SOAP body is allowed.

- Don't Forget Edit Content-Length
- This attack can be avoided in one of the following ways:
	- By disabling the SOAPAction header.
	- By configuring the firewall to inspect the SOAPAction header when filtering the coming requests.
3. SQL injection SOAP

![[Pasted image 20220329180430.png]]

- This type of attack is an input validation attack. Moreover, it is important to know that since these types of Web Services use XML files, they may also be vulnerable to XPath Injection
- To avoid them you should filter or sanitize user input. You can obtain this in the following ways:
	- By using parameterized SQL queries
	- By using stored procedures
	- By validating the user input directly
