1. **Introduction**
- Authentication is the process of verifying **who you are**.
- Authorization is **what you are able to do**: authorization attacks have to do with accessing information that the user does not have permission to access.

**An authentication factor**
1. Ownership factors : Security token, mobile phone, bank online token
2. Knowledge factors : password, PIN, secret question
3. Inherence factors : fingerprint, signature, face, retinal pattern

- The `single-factor` authentication method requires a user to provide one of the three authentication factors we just saw.
- The `two-factor` (or multi factor authentication - MFA) : 
	- Something you know: the PIN
	- Something you have: the credit/ATM card
***
2. **Common Vulnerabilities**
1. If the channel is not encrypted : man-in-the-middle
2. Brute forced : weak password, [a-zA-Z0-9]
3. Dictionary attack : weak password, wordlists : Openwall, Seclist, SkullSecurity

**Strong Password Policy**
- Length: at least 10 characters
- Never use the same password twice
- Do not include personal information and dictionary words
- Change password regularly (monthly, annually)
- Composition : (At least one uppercase char, At least one lowercase char, At least one digit char, Special characters (% $ ;))

**To avoid brute-force and dictionary attacks**
- Adds an increasing delay after each failed login attempt
- After 3 failed attempts show a CAPTCHA puzzle
- After 10 failed attempts locks the user for a certain amount of time

**1. User Enum**
- badly handled incorrect login messages is:
	- Login for user foo: invalid password
	- Login failed, invalid user ID
	- Login failed; account disabled
	- Login failed; this user is not active
	- User does not exist in the DB: show error + abort
	- User exists in the DB: retrieve user, calculate password, check if the password matches
	- A password reset for that user if the system suffers from a weakness in the password reset feature.
	- Some applications may not display the previous messages

		- Burp Comparer is the tool in Burp Suite that finds visual differences between two responses.

**2. default credentials**
- CMSs are provided with predefined user accounts.
- web developer could create test user accounts and forget to delete them.

- remember me Hackerone Reports
	- The password remember feature can be implemented through the following methods:
		- Through the browser cache
		- By storing credentials permanently within the web storage
		- By storing the credentials within a cookie : Alternatively, a token might be stored in the Cookie.
- The password input element, as with any other sensitive information, must not be cached.
	`INPUT TYPE="password" AUTOCOMPLETE="on"`
**3. web storage**
- A web developer could rely on local storage to store credentials : API call localStorage.setItem()
- Web storage is a data container accessible and writable by all pages sharing the same origin

**Best Defense**
1. Cache Browser Method Defense
- `<INPUT TYPE="password" AUTOCOMPLETE="off">`
2. Cookie Method Defense
- password must be encrypted before storing it within the cookie.
3. Web Storage Method Defense
- password must be encrypted before storing it within the cookie.

**Password Rest Feature**
- Typical Weaknesses of Password Reset Links
1. Guessable password reset link
2. Predictable password reset token
3. Recyclable password reset link

Web applications should create the password reset link and maintain the following rules: - The link should contain a token
- The token should abide to the following rules:
	- Minimum length N characters: N>6
	-  Wide Character Set: For example [A-Za-z0-9]
	-  Purely random and unpredictable
	-  Subject to expiration soon: 30 or 60 minutes

**logout**
- Delete SessionID "Incorrect Session Destruction Attack"
- BroutForce SessionID

**CAPTCHA**
- purpose of CAPTCHA is to determine and differentiate humans from bots
- led to bypassing authentication, XSS, SQL Injection
- third-party and in-house CAPTCHA schemes:
	- Cintruder
	- Bypass CAPTCHA with OCR engine
	- Decoding CAPTCHA
	- OWASP: Testing for CAPTCHA
***
**Bypassing Authorization**
- IDOR
	- Best Defence
		- Each protected page must contain a prologue. The prologue is a block of code written in a server-side scripting language (PHP, ASP.NET, JAVA).
			![[Pasted image 20220321152333.png]]
- Missing Function Level Access Control "Failure to Restrict URL Access"
	- attacker can change a parameter or the URL in order to access privileged functions
	- Attackers can usually guess links or bruteforce URLs to find unprotected pages
- Redirect
![[Pasted image 20220322045812.png]]
	- Best Defense :  A web developer using a redirect to protect content must remember to terminate the script execution after inserting the redirect statement
```
<? session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION['logged'])) { 
	header("Location: http://www.elsfoo.com/login"); die();
	} 
?> … // Protected Content …
```

- session Prediction
	- A session identifier can be easily guessed by an attacker if its generation is predictable.
	
- SQL injection 
- Local File Inclusion and Path Traversal
	- Path traversal: allows attackers to retrieve files from the web server, that are not intended to be accessible
	- Local File Inclusion: it is a type of path traversal that allows attackers to access or execute the code of a local file (local to the web server)
		`http://elswapt.site/faq.php?lang=[path_to_file]%00`
	-  path traversal : readfile($my_file )
	-  Local File Inclusion : include('files/' . $ my_file );
