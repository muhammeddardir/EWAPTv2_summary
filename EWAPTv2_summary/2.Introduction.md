1. HTTP/S Protocol Basics 
Notes: 
`\r` (Carriage Return): moves the cursors to the beginning of the line
`\n` (Line Feed): moves the cursor down to the next line
`\r\n`: is the same of hitting enter on your keyboard
***
2. Encoding

- URL Encode
- Base64 :is a binary-to-text encoding schema used to convert binary files and send them over Internet. [0 - 9],[aA - zZ] ,[+,/,=]  62 values

3. Same Origin
- This policy prevents a script or a document from getting or setting properties of another document that comes from a different origin.
- CSS stylesheets, images and scripts are loaded by the browser without consulting the policy.
- requests are initiated from within client side scripts (IE: JavaScript), or when an Ajax request is run.
- Protocol, Host, Port
- Internet Explorer works
	- Port: it does not consider the port as a Same Origin component.
	- Trust Zone: the Same Origin is not applied to domains that are in highly trusted zone (i.e. corporate domains)
- There are several exceptions to SOP restrictions:
	- window.location
	- document.domain
	- Cross window messaging
	- CORS
- HTML5 feature known as Cross Window Messaging permits different documents (iframes, popups, current window) to communicate with each other regardless of the same origin policy by using a simple synchronous mechanism. 
- Tools :
	- Firebug plugin

4. Cookie

- The `Secure flag` forces the browser to send the cookie only through HTTPS (SSL).
***
5. Session
- Sometimes the web developer prefers to store information on the server side instead of the client side.
- The main difference between `cookies` and `session` variables is that cookies are stored on the `client` whereas session variables are on the `server`.
- Also, session variables expire with the session and sessions usually expire sooner than cookies do
- SESSION=0wvCtOBWDH8w
- PHPSESSID=l3Kn5Z6Uo4pH : php
- JSESSIONID=W7DPUBgh7kT : JSP
