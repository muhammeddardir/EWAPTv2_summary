Penetration Testing Process
- Pre-engagement
- Methodologies
- Reporting
***
A `Penetration test` is a complex, cyclical process of both identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a system.

The ultimate `goal` of a penetration test is to identify and assess the client organization’s risk of exposure
***
**Pre-engagement**
During the pre-engagement phase, the peneter and the client must discuss and agree upon a number of legal and technical matters " `paperwork`: Rules of engagement"

paperwork objective :
1. The goal and scope of the engagement 
2. The timeline and milestones معالم
3. The liabilities خصوم/ responsibilities
4. The allowed techniques
5. The deliverables and expectations التسليم والتوقعات
6. The statement of work

1. Goal and Scope
Goal : 
- first question to ask the client is: Why do you want to execute a Penetration test?

Note : 
- client says "we got hacked", is a completely different than performing a penetration test for PCI DSS compliance validation.
- Do not expect that clients know what they want (this is a standard business rule, that certainly applies here).

scope
- Logical scope : for example, an entire department within the organization, an entire line of operations or even the whole organization.
- Physical scope : IP addresses,domains, subdomains, autonomous systems and so on.

3. The liabilities / responsibilities
Possible liabilities could be :
- You access sensitive data out-of-scope
- You accidentally بطريق الخطا remove data
- You accidentally cause unavailability of services
- Other catastrophic كارثي event with an impact on the organization

Responsibilities are :
- Keeping the client informed and up to date during your pentest
- Keeping reports and collected data in a safe place
- Following a code of ethics
- Nondisclosure of any information

A non-disclosure agreement (`NDA`) is part of any engagement. سياسة عدم الافصاح

`emergency plan` is a good idea for both the pentester and the client.
- put into action when things go wrong during the engagement

An emergency plan simply involves the following factors :
- The timetable
- The contact in charge of responding to the emergency plan
- The solutions to apply to the issue
***
4. The allowed techniques
`Intrusive techniques` : those that not only can cause damage,e possibility for serious embarrassment الاحراجات

common intrusive techniques :
- Brute force attacks
- Social Engineering
- Data harvesting of temporary internet files and history
- Phishing attacks
***
5. The deliverables and expectations
- The deliverables of a penetration test are `reports` or `the report`.
- arger engagements,might also require you to provide spreadsheet documents.

Penetration Testing Execution Standard (`PTES`) : 
- is an initiative being undertaken by a community of experienced penetration testers to define how penetration tests should be carried out in real world situations.
- EX : OWASP Testing guide

<center> Start Reporting </center></br>

This is a typical set of your penetration test report’s target audience groups :
- Executive
	- At executive levels, you have to speak in terms of metrics, risk mitigation and money loss.
	- Graphics and statistics go here
- IT Department
	- Here you can dive into more detail about which areas or departments are more affected and to what kind of vulnerabilities
- Development
	- Here you can provide your exploits, your proofs of concept, remediation tips, source code, etc.
	- This is usually the most technical part of your report

Vulnerabilities by Cause: 
![[Pasted image 20220313064523.png]]

Vulnerabilities by Cause:
- Perform input data sanitizing
- Use stronger ciphers
- Patch software X

examples for web applications are `OWASP Top 10` and `WASC TC`
