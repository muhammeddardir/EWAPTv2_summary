1. XML Documents and Databases

- EXtensible Markup Language
- uses it to query an XML document through XPath queries
-  mainly designed to describe data and not to display it.
- XML documents are often used as databases.
- Data can be read and written through queries and the XML database looks just like an XML document.
- unsecured XMLdocument  database (password in clear) : 
```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> # XML declaration , is not required
<users> # root element, //user
	<user id=’1’> # child element
		<username>jason</username> # /users//username,//user[@id='1']/username
		<!-- Comment -->
		<password>dh8Gjnkj</password>
	</user>
	<user id=’2’>
		<username>chris</username>
		<password>ddssdPikmd</password>
	</user>
</users>
```

2. XPath

- XPath (XML Path Language)
- Is a standard language used to query and navigate XML documents.
- XPath makes use of path expressions in order to select nodes from an XML document.
- Back to the previous XML document, the XPath query to look for a node user based on the inserted credentials is :
`//user[username/text()='<USERNAME>' and password/text()='<PASSWORD>']` = `select all where username=<USERNAME> and password='<PASSWORD `

XPATH vs SQLI
SQL `"SELECT * FROM users where username='' OR 'a'='a' ; -- AND password=''"`
AND is Boolean operator bypass by comment

- Unlike SQL, the XPath language does not permit comment expressions. The attacker must provide a specific payload to bypass a Boolean operator present in the query.
- Unlike SQL, XPath is a case-sensitive language

3. Detecting XPath Injection
- Necessary that the web application makes use of an XML database for data storage and querying.
- The detection process is the same as in SQL injection: discover parameter
- Classic probes include: APOSTROPHE `'` used as string terminator,COMMA `,` used to break integers, although any character would work
- **detect the injection blindly**
	- Trigger two conditions: TRUE `999999 or 1=1` and FALSE
	- 999999 or 1=1 we use 999999 to not get result and add `999999 or 1=1` to if condition True Get Result

4. Exploitation
- Exploits the vulnerability to perform actions such as:
	- Bypassing authentication
	- Extracting the XML document structure and contents
- Ex : Simple web application that stores user credentials in an XML document and uses XPath queries to access it
- Login : Bypassing authentication
	- Target the Username as the injection
		- `<someNode>[username='<USERNAME>' and password='<PASSWORD>']`
		- `' or 'a'= 'a' or 'a'= 'a`
		-  `//[username='' or 'a'='a' or 'a'= 'a' and password='']`

	- Target the password as the injection
		- `' or 'a'= 'a`
		- `//[username='' and password='' or 'a'='a']`
		![[Pasted image 20220403055145.png]]
- The attacker’s main goal is to extract all the XML document data 
	- The XPath language does not have a statement similar to the UNION statement in SQL, so the exploit can only be done with a BLIND technique
	- First of all, the attacker needs to detect which input data satisfies the TRUE and the FALSE conditions.
- Statements to remember during the exploit
	![[Pasted image 20220403055605.png]]
-  Identifier of the root node
	![[Pasted image 20220403055729.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20220403055816.png]]
- Name of the first child node of the root
	![[Pasted image 20220403060006.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20220403060024.png]]
- example, we will say that you know all the identifiers of the nodes: users, user, username, password	
	- The username can be accessed by using the following XPath query:
	`/users/user[position()==$i]/username`

5. Best Defending Techniques
- Filter all input data, example:
	- `$username=filterChars($_GET['username']);`
	- `$password=filterChars($_GET['password']);`
	- `$query="//user[username/text()='".$username."' and password/text()='".$password."']/username";`
