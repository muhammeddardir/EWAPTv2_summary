1. Gathering Information on Your Targets
What sorts of information are we going after?
- Infrastructure (Web server, CMS, Database…)
- Application Logic
- IPs, Domains and Subdomains
- Virtual hosts

**Tools**
- WHOIS : CLI , web interface
	- looking up domain ownership details from different databases.
	- WHOIS Protocol normally runs on TCP port 43 when use CLI
	- You Can Get From Running whois
		- Administrative contact information
		- Technical contact information
		- IP address of one of the machines

DNS : is a distributed database arranged hierarchically. Its purpose is to provide a layer of abstraction between Internet services (web, email, etc.) and the numeric addresses (IP addresses) used to uniquely identify any five machines on the Internet
- The Nameserver is the DNS server that replies to all lookup queries regarding the namespace of a domain.

- Nslookup
	- translate hostnames to IP addresses and vice versa.
	- Get All DNS query : `nslookup -querytype=ANY google.com`
	-  ISP بتاع ال  ip  ممكن بعض المؤسسات تطلع ب

1. FInd IPs From Nslookup domain.com [104.20.2.47 ,104.20.3.47] tnen
2. Nslookup www.domain.com may be Find Diffrent IPs [93.188.134.172, 93.188.134.237] 
3. Using online tools such as `arin.net`, `whois.domaintools.com` or `ripe.net`
4. Result For online Tools internet block : ISP is 141.16.0.0/12.
5. faster way to uncover the organization’s hosting scheme and ownership is by using `Netcraft` www.netcraft.com This step alternative steps 3,4

 Whois & Netcraft
***
2. Infrastructure
- Ex : web server , Apache and Microsoft IIS
- kind of web server is behind your application, OS
- URL rewriting, load balancing, script engines (like PHP, Python or Perl) and many others. `news.php?id=12` --> news/12.html OR news/12
- fingerprint of the web server
	- HTTP headers in response : Server, X-Powered-By
	- Netcraft via its enormous information database shows the webservers and historical OS information
	- nc 192.168.102.136 80
	   HEAD / HTTP/1.0
	- manual testing techniques and tools to identify a server such as:` netcat, httprint, whatweb -v , wappalyzer.`
		- Web server version
		- Installed modules
		- Web enabled devices (routers, cable modems, etc.)
	- Tools : netcat
	- `URL rewriting` is done on Apache with the mod_rewrite module or .htaccess.
		- Ex: www.example.com/news_read/112
		- If the two pages match and no 404 error is returned, we have found the URL rewriting rule.
		- As you can see, we are guessing on the parameter name, (id), which usually does not appear in the rewritten URL.
		
**Subdomain Enum**
- Netcraft : *.domain.com
- Google : site:.microsoft.com, site:.microsoft.com -inurl:www.
- Crawling / Brute force
- Tools : dnsrecon, dnsenum, subbrute, knock, fierce, theHarvester, Nmap, recon-ng
- Zone transfers : dig @nameserver axfr mydomain.com

**virtual host**
- vhost :  is simply a website that shares an IP address with one or more other virtual hosts.
- These vhosts are domains and subdomains.
- This is very common in a shared hosting environment where a multitude of websites share the same server/IP address.

- Tools
	- fierce -dns domain.com

3. Fingerprinting Frameworks and Applications

- Once we have a list of subdomains, we will apply the techniques to all of them, looking at the webpages running
- Common applications may be forums (like phpBB, vBulletin), CMS’s (like Joomla or Drupal), CRM’s, blogging platforms (like WordPress or Movable types)
- Find CMS & version 
	-  `X-Content-Encoded-By: Joomla! 2.5` :header expouser
	- source code
	- Joomla URLS are made of 3 main parts: 
		- `index.php?option=%component_name%&task=%task_value%`
- Docman : `index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=100`
***
4. Fingerprinting Custom Applications
- What is it for?
- Does it allow user registration?
- Does it have an administration panel?
- Does it take input from the user?
- What kind of input?
- Does it accept file uploads?
- Does it use JavaScript or Ajax or Flash? And so on

-  Functional Graph

- html Redirect `<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; url=http://www.example.com/">`

5. Enumerating Resources
- as subdomains, website structure, hidden files, configuration files and any additional information leaked because of misconfiguration.
- crawler
- hidden FIle : DirBuster
- back up files and source code files : 
	- server is instructed to treat special file extensions as cgi files
	- A good list of back up files extension follows: bak, bac, old, 000, ~ ,01,  _bak, 001, inc,  Xxx
	- The extension .inc stands for include and it has been an abused extension many times; in ASP 3.0
		- these files were used to contain source code to be included as part of the main asp page execution.
***
6. Information Disclosure Through Misconfiguration
- directories listing :create script :To parent directory , Directory Listing For, Index of
- Logs : configuration.php.bak, configuration.php.old,
- FileUpload : PUT Method
	- mistakes an administrator can make in the configuration of the web server, leaving a directory writable by anyone
	- check
		OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1 
		Host: targetsite.com
	- if OPTIONS Not work Test PUT Manual
	- Find writable Directory then
		`PUT /writable_dir/test.html HTTP/1.1`
	- It is important to provide the Content-length

7. Google Hacking
- intitle:"Apache HTTP Server" intitle:"documentation"
- intitle:"Apache HTTP Server" intitle:"documentation" site:target.com
- "Index of" bak
- "Directory listing for" bak
- filetype:"bak", filetype:"inc"
